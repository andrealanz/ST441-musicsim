# Exploring the Simulation of Music

### Author: Andrea Lanz

A project that focuses on the quantitative representation of music and
how it can be simulated. This project will explore the relationship
between the numerical information behind sound and what is considered
music. Using several related sources, this project will mainly focus on
frequency of sound and analyzing the patterns of frequency that can be
seen in music.
